## Install and FAQ

### Install

Sorry, though the apk is available, but allow me to polish its aesthetics for another few days.

### Supported Platforms?

Both `android` and `ios` are supported, but currently I don't want to pay the money to list the app on App Store.
So for the foreseeable future, only `android apk` will be released.

### Supported Languages?

- English
- 简体中文
- 日本語 (if anyone volunteers to translate for me)
